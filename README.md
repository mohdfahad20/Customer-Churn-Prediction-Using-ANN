# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Using-ANN

In this project, I built an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict customer churn.

What I Did:
Loaded a telecom customer dataset

Cleaned the data (removed unnecessary columns, handled missing values)

Converted categorical data to numeric using encoding

Scaled the numerical features

Built an ANN model using Keras

Trained the model on the data

Evaluated the model using accuracy and other metrics
